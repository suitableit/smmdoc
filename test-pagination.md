# Pagination Optimization Test

## Changes Made

### User Services Page (`app/(protected)/services/page.tsx`)
1. **Removed "All Services" option** - Changed from unlimited loading to max 500 services per page
2. **Simplified pagination** - Removed load more functionality, implemented proper Previous/Next pagination
3. **Memory optimization** - Limited API calls to prevent memory issues
4. **Updated dropdown options**:
   - 50 per page
   - 100 per page  
   - 200 per page
   - 500 per page (max)

### Admin Services Page (`app/(protected)/admin/services/page.tsx`)
1. **Added proper pagination state management**:
   - `currentPage`, `totalPages`, `totalServices`, `pageSize`
2. **Updated data fetching** - Uses pagination parameters in API calls
3. **Added pagination controls**:
   - Previous/Next buttons
   - Page size selector (100, 250, 500, 1000)
   - Page information display
4. **Memory optimization** - Limited to max 1000 services per page

### API Endpoints
1. **Admin Services API** (`app/api/admin/services/route.ts`):
   - Added proper pagination support
   - Limited "all" option to max 1000 services
   - Added `isShowAll` and `limit` in response

2. **User Services API** - Already had pagination, just optimized limits

## Benefits
1. **Prevents memory crashes** - No more unlimited service loading
2. **Better performance** - Smaller data chunks load faster
3. **Improved UX** - Clear pagination controls and progress indicators
4. **Scalable** - Can handle large numbers of services without issues

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin/services` - Should show pagination controls
2. Navigate to `/services` - Should show optimized pagination
3. Try different page sizes - Should load appropriate number of services
4. Test search functionality - Should work with pagination
5. Test category filtering - Should maintain pagination

## Memory Usage
- Before: Could load 10,000+ services at once (memory crash risk)
- After: Max 1000 services per page (safe memory usage)
