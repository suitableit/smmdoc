# Transaction Approval Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (app/(protected)/admin/transactions/page.tsx)
- Modified `confirmApprove` function to send `modifiedTransactionId` and `transactionType` to backend
- Updated button disabled condition to require Transaction ID for both deposit and withdrawal
- Fixed transaction state update to use the modified transaction ID

### 2. Backend Changes (app/api/admin/funds/[id]/approve/route.ts)
- Added request body parsing to get `modifiedTransactionId` and `transactionType`
- Added validation to require transaction ID for deposit transactions
- Updated database update to save the modified transaction ID in `transaction_id` field
- Updated email template to use the modified transaction ID
- Updated response to include the modified transaction ID

## Test Steps

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Go to admin dashboard
   - Navigate to transactions page

2. **Find a Pending Deposit Transaction**
   - Look for transactions with status "Pending"
   - Click the approve button (green checkmark)

3. **Test Transaction ID Modification**
   - Popup should appear with "Approve Transaction" title
   - Should show transaction details (ID, User, Amount, Method, Phone)
   - Should have "Modify Transaction ID *" field with a default value
   - Try to approve without entering Transaction ID - should show error
   - Enter a custom Transaction ID (e.g., "TXN-123456789")
   - Click "Approve Transaction"

4. **Verify Success**
   - Should show success toast message
   - Transaction status should change to "Success"
   - User balance should be updated
   - Email should be sent to user with the modified transaction ID

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Transaction ID field is required for deposits
- ✅ Custom Transaction ID is saved to database
- ✅ User receives email with correct Transaction ID
- ✅ Transaction status updates to Success
- ✅ User balance is incremented
- ✅ Admin sees updated transaction in list

## Database Fields Updated

- `addFund.status` → "Success"
- `addFund.admin_status` → "Success" 
- `addFund.transaction_id` → Modified Transaction ID
- `user.balance` → Incremented by transaction amount
- `user.total_deposit` → Incremented by transaction amount
